# Learning Repo

This repo is for following tutorials, trying out new things, and generally expanding my technical horizons.
I will **try** to keep it tidy and project based (each internal project should be self-contained)

I was very lazy for most of the python projects and just used a generic virtual environment with a bunch of packages installed. **Sometime in the future I will actually make individual poetry environments to be somewhat professional**. In the meantime, if you really want to run these then run a cheeky `pip install -r --user bloated_requirements.txt` to get my awfully bloated generic environment.
